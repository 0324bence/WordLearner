# Word learner

An android application that was made for a classmate of mine, who struggles to learn new words in foreign languages.

## Main features:
- Good looking ui created using material design principles
- Simple way to add new words
- Ability to group words for the sake organization
- A uneque priority system
- Ability to export words into, and import words from csv files

### About the priority system
The apps priority system works by increasing the prority of word pairs that the user didn't know, and decreasing the it for the ones they did. This helps avoid seeing known words, and helps them learn the ones they don't know.

The app also employs a deck system, which works by removing the words the user knew from the rotation until it the deck is reset or it is emptied, at which point the rotation starts from the beginning and all words get put into the deck
